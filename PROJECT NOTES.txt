normalize the song 
key is important with switching between songs IT should be alphabetical A/B/C/D/E/F/G
scale minor / major 
MINOR usually a emotional / epic / sad vibe song / powerful
MAJOR uptempo happy / lalalall oh mcdonald had a farm

 

dynamics  - if song ends loud you dont want to start with a quiet song - singing etc.
